	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>This is my second paragraph <br/>
	(which is below a horizontal line. Also, has a line break).</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		Now, I have used the another tag that preserves source file formatting.
		Hence I can print fancy (not that fancy in reality) Java code like
	</p>
	<pre>
		public int cube(int num) {
			return num * num * num;
		}
	</pre>
	<p>without messing with its formatting.</p>
	<hr>
	<h1>Using nested HTML tags, I can print <i>italic</i> font in this heading.</h1>
	<h2>I can also <u>underline</u> specific words in a different type of heading.</h2>
	<p>Or I can print words in a <b>bold</b> format, or have <strike>striked out words</strike>, or use <sup>supercript</sup> or <sub>subscript</sub> typefaces.</p>
	<p>Also in simple formatting, I can</p>
	<p align="left">print left aligned sentences/paragraphs,</p>
	<p align="center">print center aligned paragraphs,</p>
	<p align="right">or print left aligned paragraphs.</p>
	<p style = "font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;">I can also change the letter format as well as the color of this paragraph.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>Now, I can also attach hyperlinks to any website I can, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4BtydTW0H8cTwS2XmMZFA">here</a>, I have linked to Bob's YouTube page.</p>
